* Ansible Powerplay Release Notes
  With each release, we promise to make some entries here so that
  you may be informed. We shall always try to maintain backwards compability.
  
  If something potentially affects backwards compability, we'll bump the minor
  number. For "milestone" upgrades and/or compability breaks, we'll rev the
  major number. Of course, you can read all about it here.

   Bugs and missing features that needs to be addressed. As they are,
   we'll remove them from this list.

   | 2016-06-07 | execution planning dump (-v2) and -b | When using -b to select an individual book, the execution planning does not reflect this filtration.                                                     |
   | 2016-06-05 | version                              | Command does not work properly. It hangs.                                                                                                                |
   | 2016-04-07 | --extra-vars                         | Powerplay duplicates keys on extra vars if already specified in the Powerplay.                                                                           |
   | 2016-03-11 | Grouping                             | Groups executes in parallel instead of serially.                                                                                                         |

   | 2016-03-03 | Status dump out of order             | Currently a bit out of order due to the fact that the output are being run in different threads and so the text is being printed nondeterministically.   |
   | 2016-02-20 | Platforms other than Linux           | We need to test on Mac OSX and Windows. Should work fine on Macs. I do not plan to support Windows in general, but may accept pull requests to that end. |

** Wish List
   Well, we can always wish upon a star... but it will take
   my time and dedication to make stars happen. :p

   |       Date | Wish                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
   |------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | 2016-02-20 | Integration with Jenkins  | I have no idea what form this will take                                                                                                                                       |
   |            | Curses integration        | Basically, the tmux integration is used because it was quick to do. But what I really want to do is full Curses support, similar with what you see with htop and other tools. |
   | 2016-02-26 | Better and Error handling | When there's a failure in the underlying Ansible playbook, we want to handle that better in Powerplay. This would be a part of the Curses upgrade to come later.              |
   | 2016-02-29 | Configuration file        | Add a (presumably yaml format) configuration file in a few key locations.                                                                                                     |
   |            | Name Completion           | Shell integration with name completion features of bash.                                                                                                                      |
