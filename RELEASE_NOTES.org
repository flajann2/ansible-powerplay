* Ansible Powerplay Release Notes
  With each release, we promise to make some entries here so that
  you may be informed. We shall always try to maintain backwards compability.
  
  If something potentially affects backwards compability, we'll bump the minor
  number. For "milestone" upgrades and/or compability breaks, we'll rev the
  major number. Of course, you can read all about it here.

   | 2016-02-20 | Non tmux output            | Redirected to stdout, but really needs to go to the current tty.                                                                                         |
   | 2016-02-20 | Platforms other than Linux | We need to test on Mac OSX and Windows. Should work fine on Macs. I do not plan to support Windows in general, but may accept pull requests to that end. |

   | 2016-02-20 | Curses integration       | Basically, the tmux integration is used because it was quick to do. But what I really want to do is full Curses support, similar with what you see with htop and other tools. |
